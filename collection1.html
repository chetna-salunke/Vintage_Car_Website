                    <h2>1929 Packard 640 Convertible Coupe.</h2><br>
                    <p>Packard’s well-earned reputation for exceptional quality, engineering prestige, and styling fit for sophisticated consumers had been well established when 1929’s “Sixth Series” models debuted in August of 1928. As customers had come to expect, a wide range of catalog body styles on four different chassis were available with the model code denoting the wheelbase length: the 626 and 633 Standard Eight, with wheelbases of 126” and 133”, the Speedster Eight on a 134” wheelbase, the upmarket Custom Eight and Top-Of-The-Line Deluxe Eight on a 140” and 145” wheelbases, respectively. These upmarket Custom Eight and Deluxe Eight models were fitted with Packard’s larger, 106 horsepower, 384.8 cubic-inch, nine main bearing Straight Eight engine, and carried an equally market-topping price tag of up to $5,900, compared to the Ford Model A’s pedestrian $435. With the cost of entry for these cars it’s not hard to believe that President of Packard, Alvan Macauley’s quote "Ask the Man Who Owns One”, became the company’s slogan. <br><br>
                        The car on offer is a well-preserved older restoration that performs well and now displays a moderate patina earned through time and enjoyment on the road. The body is finished in a handsome combination of in two-tone complementary toffee and caramel brown with orange pinstripes and a dark brown Haartz cloth convertible top. It’s a surprisingly attractive combination that sets this car apart from others, and while the paint shows some cracking and imperfections, it maintains a certain charm and appeal in its patina. It sits proudly on the road, with painted wire wheels adorned with white wall tires. The curvaceous fenders hug the engine cover, and hold the two spare painted wire wheels, matching the primary wheel’s tan finish. The chrome and brightwork all present beautifully for the age of restoration, a few imperfections from cleaning and polishing, but free from any neglect. Up front the imposing Packard radiator shell features the reclining Adonis mascot and is protected by a stainless-steel stone guard, while out back is a period accessory trunk with matching cover.  <br> <br>                   
                        Inside this convertible coupe, the mottled brown upholstery is accented by wooden door caps and roof bows, while the dashboard’s expansive wood graining is home to the minimalist instrument cluster. A fuel level gauge sits between the barrel-type speedometer and odometer showing just over 2000 miles and Jaeger clock, while the temperature, tachometer, and voltmeter, sweep gauges sit above and below. With the miles shown, this is an example of a well-loved restoration that was enjoyed instead of hidden away from the world.   <br>
