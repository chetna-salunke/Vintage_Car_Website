                    <h2>1926 Rolls-Royce Phantom Cabriolet.</h2><br>
                    <p>Introduced in 1925, the Rolls-Royce "New Phantom"—later known as the Phantom I—represented a significant evolution from its predecessor, the celebrated "Silver Ghost." Although the "Silver Ghost" had already garnered a stellar reputation as "The Best Car in the World," Henry Royce was meticulous about not diverging too far from a winning formula. The new model retained similarities in chassis design but featured a noteworthy upgrade under the hood. The 7,668cc engine was equipped with a one-piece, detachable cast iron cylinder head and pushrod-operated overhead valves, inspired by the successful 20hp model. This configuration offered improved efficiency and performance, while the separate engine and gearbox design adhered to Royce's conservative engineering philosophy. <br><br>
                        Writing of the "New Phantom" in May 1925, the British magazine, The Autocar said: "As regards detail it is practically hopeless to go into any one point, for there is not a single minor component of the chassis which has not its interest and is not carried out in a manner suggesting that the designers were able to deal with every problem, great or small, unhampered by the possible cost of solution, intent on making the best mechanism for the job in hand."  <br><br>                                          
                        This 1926 Rolls-Royce Phantom I Enclosed Cabriolet, with custom coachwork by Barker & Co., exemplifies the luxurious collaboration between Rolls-Royce and one of its most esteemed coachbuilders. Barker & Co. had a long-standing relationship with Rolls-Royce, beginning from their transition from carriage builders to automotive craftsmen. The enduring partnership led to numerous iconic vehicles, including the original Silver Ghost and, subsequently, the New Phantom. Barker’s designs consistently met the exacting standards of Rolls-Royce's elite clientele, blending functionality with stately elegance. <br><br>                                      
                        Our featured Phantom I was commissioned by Alfred Loewenstein, a distinguished financier from Belgium and one of the wealthiest men of his era. Loewenstein, renowned for his investments in electric power and synthetic textiles, required a car that matched his grand lifestyle. Barker delivered an ingeniously engineered Cabriolet with multi-season versatility. The car could transform from a fully enclosed saloon with wind-up windows to a partially open Sedanca de Ville configuration for chauffeur-driven comfort, or fully open for leisure outings.</p>
